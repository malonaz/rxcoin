The diagram above shows how an operation (here a transaction on the bitcoin protocol) is carried out.\\
1) You create a hash of the operation data (e.g. sender, receiver, message). Your private key is then used to sign this hash,
to create a digital signature.\\
2) You broadcast the operation data to the mining network, together with your digital signature and your public key.\\
3) Now, mining nodes can compute inexpensively whether your public key and your digital signature where made using the same private key.\\
4) If the transaction is valid, it is added to the aforementioned pool of operations to be placed in a block.
