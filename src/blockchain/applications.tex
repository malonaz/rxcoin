Let us now briefly discuss a few important applications of blockchain.
Earlier, I repeatedly mentioned \emph{operations} rather than \emph{transactions} intentionally.
When speaking about the infamous Bitcoin, it is accurate enough to speak of \emph{transactions} as its blockchain
only allows a small set of transaction-related operations.
Bitcoin and its blockchain thus form a cryptocurrency, with limited use beyond transacting at poor lentency.

In comes Ethereum...
Whereas Bitcoin restricts it blockchain to transaction-related operations, Ethereum has embraced all operations.
More precisely, they have implemented a turing-complete blockchain.
A system is said to be turing complete if it can be used to solve any computable problem.
Ethereum's blockchain is thus a platform rather than a cryptocurrency.
They designed a coding language that Ethereum mining software can interpret. 
A user is free broadcast any data and/or code to the platform, and as miners validate a block,
they execute this code to update the state of the database.
Codes, often referred to as \emph{smart contracts}, can call on other contracts, or be called upon.
Using this framework, anyone can create a application that uses Ethereum's decentralized database.
Today, most of the cryptocurrencies or ICOs you read about, have not implemented a blockchain themselves,
but rather, use Ethereum's blockchain.

RxCoin aims to disrupt the healthcare industry by introducing a blockchain devoted to healthcare-related operations.
One that would see its decentralized database bring transparency about this opaque industry
and remove existing friction between manufacturers, prescribers and patients.
