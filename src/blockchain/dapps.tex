Traditional web applications implement a web client that makes API requests to a company's backend server,
typically \emph{GET} and \emph{POST} requests to write to or read from the server's database.
Any logical operation initiated by a request occurs on the company's backend server, and the data is owned by the corporation.
Distributed applications do not communicate with any server but instead, request and write data directly to the blockchain.
Logical operations are contained in \emph{smart contracts} and executed by mining nodes.
The data is decentralized and owned by the users of the blockchain.
