In this paper, we introduce RxChain, a blockchain devoted to healthcare that aims to disrupt the healthcare industry.
RxChain aims to disrupt the healthcare industry by introducing a blockchain devoted to healthcare-related operations.
One that would see its decentralized database bring transparency about this opaque industry
and remove existing friction between manufacturers, prescribers and patients.

RxChain will implement a turing complete set of instructions, such that it can execute any program.
It will use its proprietary \emph{RxCoin} to pay its miners and charge for operations it executes.
Rather than focus on cryptocurrency, RxChain will focus on growing a community of distributed apps,
centered around healthcare.
we will pave the way for the industry to join our community and simultaneously demonstrate the potential of our blockchain
by developping two distributed applications, available on all platforms (iOS, Android, Web  Browser, etc).
