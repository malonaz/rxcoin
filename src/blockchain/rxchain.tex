In this paper, we introduce RxChain, a blockchain devoted to healthcare that aims to disrupt the healthcare industry.
RxChain aims to disrupt the healthcare industry by introducing a blockchain devoted to healthcare-related operations.
One that would see its decentralized database bring transparency about this opaque industry
and remove existing friction between manufacturers, prescribers and patients.

RxChain will implement a turing complete set of instructions, such that it can execute any program.
It will use its proprietary \emph{RxCoin} to pay its miners and charge for operations it executes.
RxChain exists because we believe that cryptocurrencies are a poor application of blockchain.
Blockchain technology yet holds value as a decentralized computer and database.
