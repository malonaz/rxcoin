Hence, we can sketch out a product development timeline. Initially, we would design RxCoin's mining architecture as a simple PoW system. This will ensure the early development of RxCoin by guaranteeing miners seizable financial incentives and thus establishing a core mining community. In turn, RxCoin will be seen as trustworthy, reliable and will gain visibiliy in the cryptocurrency world, thus hastening the pace of user acquisition. When the number of miners increase and as our supply of new coins diminishes much faster than the price increase, we will have to increase the computational complexity of our puzzles. Then, when it becomes uncompetitive for small miners to continue validating blocks, we will upgrade to an ASIC-proof PoW to avoid excessive mining centralisation. Eventually, we would migrate to a mixed PoW/PoS system.
