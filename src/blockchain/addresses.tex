Any user may generate any number of private keys free of cost.
A series of cryptographic hash functions are applied to the private key to derive a public key from it.
To put it simply, hash functions are functions f(x) = y, such that given x, it is computationally inexpensive to find y,
but infeasible to compute x given y.
This public key is hashed for compression purposes to form an address.
This address is what will be present in the decentralized database, for any of operations you partake in.
