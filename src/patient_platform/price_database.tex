Once the relevant drug selected, the patient will see, for equivalent dosage, the real-time price of equivalent drugs, in different countries and postage costs allowing him to determine the cheapest drug.The patient will be able also to compare the price of proposed drugs with the one at the local pharmacy and will see a "yearly cumulative savings counter" \\

When the patient desires to purchase a drug, he can do so in dollars (with a premium) or in RxCoins (at a discount and with added benefits). 
Eventually we will move our platform to RxCoins only.
In addition, for non-prescription drugs the patient will be able set up automated drug orders.
