Blockchains are basically just directed graphs i.e vertices linked by pointers that flow in one direction. However, these graphs one important property: they are acyclic. Indeed, they cannot contain any loops because we need an objective genesis for validation procedures to be well-defined. Such graphs are also called trees. Nonetheless, thanks to these constraints, we analyse and construct the best blockchains from both a security and a computational perspective by doing some advanced graph theory.
