Our first distributed application focus on assisting the prescriber-patient relationship.
RxChain's first distributed app aims to streamline the prescribing process through use of the blockchain.
Using RxChain, doctors will write prescriptions as smart contracts, securely embedded in RxChain.
The nature of prescription data makes it particularly attractive to blockchain applications, for the following reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
  
  \item It is written to one and one person only
  \item Only the person for whom it was written for may redeem it
  \item It can only be redeemed once or every X days for a duration, as specified by the prescriber
  \item It cannot be redeemed past expiry date, as specifed by the prescriber
  \item Prescription data requires very little memory to store

\end{enumerate}

As we will see, these properties play well to the blockchain's immutability and decentralized properties.
Moreover, modern blockchains' $\sim$5 minutes latency will cover any of these operations.
Our distributed, decentralized RxChain will encode these legal requirements in a seamless and fault-proof way,
combining clever incentives and technological architecture.
