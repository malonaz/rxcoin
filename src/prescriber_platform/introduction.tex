Our first distributed application focus on assisting the prescriber-patient relationship.
octors’ administrative burden will be significantly reduced by using the RxChain for prescriptions.
Indeed, repeated and sequential prescriptions can be written in one go and securely embedded in RxChain.
Further, following popularity of drugs in the chain doctors will be able to recommend and prescribe cheaper
drugs to their patients according to best practices.
Furthermore, when a patient wants to effectuate a transaction legally requiring a prescription,
he will need to get the prescription’s validity legally confirmed by a pharmacist.
Our distributed, decentralized RxChain encodes these legal requirements in a seamless and fault-proof way,
combining clever incentives and technological architecture.
