Upon downloading the app, users will be assigned a private key generated through their Social Security Number
along with a derived public key.
Prescribers will have to upload proof that they are legally allowed to prescribe.
Validation of their status will be written to the blockchain database.
Upon conclusion of diagnosis, prescribers will have the ability to encrypt their prescription using the patient's public key
and securely push their prescription to RxChain, along with any parameters such as an expiration date.
This prescription will live on the chain, encrypted as to respect privacy and anomnity, and evolving as its parameters dictate it.
Patients will be able to redeem their prescription at the pharmacy, or on our manufacturer-consumer platform, to consume their prescription.
The prescription will be associated to the patient's public key on the RxChain decentralized database and the private key will be used to verify the patient's identity.
Public and private keys will be abstracted away from the users, as for all apps that follow RxChain's app development guidelines.
