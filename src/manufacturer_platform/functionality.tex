Upon opening a public account on the RxChain, drug manufacturers will be able to upload the name, descriptions, target population level of prescription requirement and clinical trial success of the drug, effectively creating smart contracts embedded in the blockchain. These standard contracts will have updatable parameters such as price, quantity and repeated shipments, allowing for a tailored, sequential delivery in time of drugs. Once payment is received by the smart contract, drugs are dispatched via a partner distribution company to the patient. Only after receiving payment from a patient in RxCoins/dollars and the patient validating adequate reception of the drugs will the contract be fully executed.

This protocol will allow manufacturers to gain insight on real-time market demand for certain drugs, as well as directly advertise, real-time through the RxChain price discounts. 
Finally, manufacturers could purchase access to deeper client analytics thanks to the multi-layered cryptographic capabilities of patients, as described in the following section.
