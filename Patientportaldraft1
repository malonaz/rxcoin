\section{Drug classification, documentation and comparison}
Upon entering the platform, the patient will be able to go through a bayesian network and determine illnesses matching description of his symptoms and the relevant drugs according to age and allergies. This could be upgraded to a chatbot inteface later. Integration with online doctor services also needs to be investigated.\\

Once the kind of medication is determined, all generics legally available in the united states will be displayed, under all forms (hard pills,soft pills, syrup bottles, drops) with the corresponding documentation consisting of dosage, active ingredients, counter-indications and period of use.The patient will also be able to compare all the datafields of selected drugs and rate them. A formula promoting a combination of the highest ranked/cheapest drugs will determine the order in which the patient sees the drugs, as well as the amount of marketing money sent by the manufacturers.The medical data could come from the FDA and the clinical trials.

\section{Price database and graphs in real-time}
Once the relevant drug selected, the patient will see, for equivalent dosage, the real-time price of equivalent drugs, in different countries and postage costs allowing him to determine the cheapest drug.The patient will be able also to compare the price of proposed drugs with the one at the local pharmacy and will see a "yearly cumulative savings counter" \\

When the patient desires to purchase a drug, he can do so in dollars (with a premium) or in RxCoins (at a discount and with added benefits). 
Eventually we will move our platform to RxCoins only.
In addition, for non-prescription drugs the patient will be able set up automated drug orders.

\section{Map of relevant manufacturers}
The patient will see a map of relevant factories and will be able to browse per geographical region the different generics.
